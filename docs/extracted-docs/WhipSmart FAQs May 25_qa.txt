===Q&A-002===
Q: What is a novated lease?  
A: A novated lease is a three-way agreement between an employee, their employer, and a finance company. Under this arrangement, the employer makes lease payments on behalf of the employee, which are deducted from the employee’s pre-tax salary. This setup can lead to significant tax savings and simplifies vehicle ownership by bundling costs like maintenance, insurance, and registration into a single monthly payment.

Q: How do novated lease payments affect tax and superannuation?
