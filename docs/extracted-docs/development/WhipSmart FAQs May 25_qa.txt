===Q&A-002===
Q: What is a novated lease?  
A: A novated lease is a three-way agreement between an employee, their employer, and a finance company. Under this arrangement, the employer makes lease payments on behalf of the employee, which are deducted from the employee’s pre-tax salary. This setup can lead to significant tax savings and simplifies vehicle ownership by bundling costs like maintenance, insurance, and registration into a single monthly payment.

===Q&A-022===
Q: How do novated lease payments affect tax and superannuation?  
A: Novated lease payments made from pre-tax income can reduce an employee’s taxable income, potentially leading to tax savings. However, the value of the benefit might be added back for superannuation guarantee calculations or other purposes. It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor or tax specialist to understand the specific impacts. Additionally, a novated lease helps save on income tax over the life of the lease. WhipSmart specializes in leases for electric vehicles, which are currently exempt from Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT).
