===Q&A-005===
Q: How are pay deductions and invoicing handled in a novated lease?  
A: WhipSmart invoices the employer monthly and direct debits the agreed lease amount, including GST. The employer applies a deduction to the employee's pay template, deducting the GST-free amount pre-tax and claiming the GST back. WhipSmart provides a deduction schedule to match the monthly invoice to weekly or fortnightly pay cycles. If the vehicle is FBT-exempt (e.g., an electric vehicle), all deductions are pre-tax. If the vehicle incurs FBT, a portion of the deduction is post-tax to account for fringe benefits tax.

===Q&A-007===
Q: How does FBT reporting work for novated leases?  
A: Employers must provide an FBT report to the ATO for the fringe benefits tax (FBT) year (1 April to 31 March). The percentage of business use claimed for the vehicle reduces the FBT owed. If the vehicle is FBT-exempt (e.g., an electric vehicle), no FBT is due.

===Q&A-009===
Q: What are the options at the end of a novated lease?  
A: At the end of a novated lease, the employee can:  
1. Sell or trade the car. If the sale price (including GST) exceeds the residual price, the employee retains the difference. If less, they pay the difference.  
2. Re-lease the car and retain tax benefits. The residual (ex GST) becomes the new vehicle price for calculating lease payments.  
3. Keep the car by paying off the residual (including GST). Note: GST is applied if the residual is paid out, but not if re-leased.
